# Guild Wars 2 Snow Crows Adaptive Meta Profit (GW2SCAMP)

### 1.1 üì£ INTRODUCTION

Snow Crows Adaptive Meta Profit (SCAMP) is a Discord bot designed for the MMO Guild Wars 2 (GW2) to identify gear and consumable items in each current character class build on [Snow Crows](https://snowcrows.com/builds/) that can be crafted and sold by the user for potential profit in the in-game Trading Post (TP). Please note that the sell prices listed from GW2SCAMP are calculated from [gw2tp](https://www.gw2tp.com/recipes) and may not exactly match the values listed on gw2efficiency. 

**This bot is not directly affiliated with Snow Crows.**

`/metaprofit` -- *Displays an aggregate list of items across all snowcrows build pages that are potentially "profitable" to craft and sell on the TP. Each item is listed as a hyperlink to its associated gw2efficiency crafting page followed by a rough estimate of the player's profit after listing the item. This iteration of GW2SCAMP is scheduled to go offline for a few minutes every 6 hours or so to update the item list.*

`/gw2joke` -- *Picks a random AI-generated joke from GW2Jokes.txt to send to the user*

`/d20` -- *Rolls a 20-sided die for miscellaneous purposes. Can also /d100, /d12, /d10, /d8, /d6, or /d4 commands as well*

`/coinflip` -- *A simple coin flip*
