# Guild Wars 2 Snow Crows Adaptive Meta (GW2SCAM)

### 1.1 üì£ INTRODUCTION

Snow Crows Adaptive Meta (SCAM) is a Discord bot designed for the MMO Guild Wars 2 (GW2) to identify gear and consumable items in each current character class build on [Snow Crows](https://snowcrows.com/builds/) that can be crafted and sold by the user for potential profit in the in-game Trading Post (TP). Please note that the sell prices listed from GW2SCAM are calculated from [gw2tp](https://www.gw2tp.com/recipes) and may not exactly match the values listed on gw2efficiency.

`/metaprofit` -- *Displays an aggregate list of items across all snowcrows build pages that are potentially "profitable" to craft and sell on the TP. Each item is listed as a hyperlink to its associated gw2efficiency crafting page followed by a rough estimate of the player's profit after listing the item. This list will update regularly once every hour or so.*
